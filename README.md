## Project mission

This project is just an idea at the moment. You can already see from the installation "instructions" (they don't work) what the basic idea is though.

iOS, OS X, and Android can be daunting at times, but so was the world of dynamic web applications and we solved that too didn't we.

If you have ideas, open up an Issue on GitHub and start putting your thoughts into it.
